# DataProjectEnrichment
In this project, we used two cohorts of rats. One cohort underwent an olfactory enrichment phase in their home cages, while the other did not. 
The code in this repository aims to assess combined retro/orthonasal preference learning in order to better understand the impact this kind of enrichment may have. 
Each animal performed in a pre and post training preference test, where the preference between carvone and cis-hex was evaluated.
