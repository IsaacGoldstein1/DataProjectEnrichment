# DataProjectEnrichment
In this project, we used two cohorts of rats. One cohort underwent an olfactory enrichment phase in their home cages, while the other did not. 
The code in this repository aims to assess combined retro/orthonasal preference learning in order to better understand the impact this kind of enrichment may have. 
Each animal performed in a pre and post training preference test, where the preference between carvone and cis-hex was evaluated. 
To run any of the cluster codes:
1. The data file needs to be downloaded as well as the code file.
2. Import the new data file and then in the part of the cluster code where the data file is called
3. Make sure you type character for character the name of the data file.
